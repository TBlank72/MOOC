		<p>What is a database?  A <b>database</b> is a program that stores 
		and retrieves <span>large amounts of structured</span> data.  Servers 
		are also database servers, or there can be a specific server just for 
		databases.  Database servers will comunicate with the server that is 
		communicating with your browser.

		<div class="hbox"><h2>Tables</h2></div>
		<p><b>Tables</b> in a database are made up of columns and rows.  
		Generally every row will have an ID in the first column.  Tables allow 
		you to organize stored data for retrieval.  They may contain username, 
		email, passwords, URL, etc.  Each time a user submits something on the 
		site, a new row will be created with the new data, or data will be updated 
		in a current row.

		<p>
			<ul>Downsides of querying data by hand(Python, etc):
				<li> error-prone</li>
				<li> tedious</li>
				<li> slow</li>
			</ul>  
		Databases make querying data much easier and faster

		<div class="hbox"><h2>Types of Databases</h2></div>
		<p>
			<ul>Major Types of Databases
				<li>SQL - (relational)</li>
				Postgresql, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle($$$)
				<li>Google AppEngine's Datastore</li>
				Similar to SQL
				<li>Dynamo - from Amazon</li>
				completely different from SQL
				<li>NoSQL</li>
				Mongo, Couch - Try to solve limitations of SQL

		<div class="hbox"><h2>SQL</h2></div>
		<p>SQL or, <b>Structured Query Language</b>, is not really a 
		programming language.  It's really a language for expressing queries.  
		It was invented in the 1970's long before the Web.  A basic SQL query 
		looks like this: <br>
		SELECT * FROM links WHERE id = 5;<br>
		<span>Select</span> means "fetch data". * means "all columns".  
		links is the "table" you are fetching data from.  id = 5 is the "constraint."  
		In plain english, this reads:  "Select all from links where id = 5".  
		The first section, the [Select *], is what you're selecting.  It could say 
		something like "Select URL, title" if you just want to querry URL and 
		titles.  The from clause, [FROM links], is saying "from links table".  
		The where clause, [Where id = 5], is referring to which <span>rows</span> 
		in your table you want to return.  The WHERE Clause is not required 
		if you want to return everything from your table.  The sqlite3 module 
		lets you use SQL in python.  ORDER BY is another clause is SQL.  It 
		could look like this: <br>
		SELECT * FROM links<br>
		WHERE votes > 10<br>
		ORDER BY votes DESC<br>
		The default order is ASC, ascending.

		<div class="hbox"><h2>SQL Join Query</h2></div>
		<p>You will normally have multiple tables of a variety of data.  You will 
		probably always have a User table with user info.  ID should always be a 
		value in your user table so that all other tables can have a User-ID column 
		that matches any other data to the User.  The <b>SQL Joins</b> method 
		just allows you to search for data in one table based on a value in another 
		table.  Joins are not used very ofter, however, they are included in almost 
		every SQL tutorial.  
		</p>

		<div class="hbox"><h2>Indexes</h2></div>
		<p>So far we've been using sequential scans, or looking through an entire 
		list of something and, if we find what we are looking for, we return some 
		value.  <b>Indexes</b> increase the speed of queries dramatically.  They 
		are pretty much like a dictionary "key:value" pair in python.  Instead of 
		asking to search through an entire list of something, you may tell is to 
		return xyz[5].  So the program jumps straight to that index instead of 
		iterating through the entire list.  
		</p>

		<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>ACID</h2></div>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>A</b>tomicity - All parts of a transaction succeed or fail together.</li>
			<li><b>C</b>onsistency - The database will always be consistent.  For 
			example, any value that affects another should be updated within the same 
			transaction.</li>
			<li><b>I</b>solation - No transaction can interfere with, or affect, another.</li>
			<li><b>D</b>urability - Once a transaction is comitted, it won't be lost.</li>
		</ul>
		There are always tradeoffs.  No database meets 100% of the ACID requirements.
