	<h1>Networking Notes</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Network</h2></div>
		<p>A <b>network</b> is a group of entities that can communicate even though
		they are not directly connected.  Two ways to measure networks are
		latency and bandwith.  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Latency</h2></div>
		<p><b>Latency</b> is the time that it takes for a message to get from the
		source to the destination.  It's the duration of time between the time
		the source starts sending to the time the receiver starts receiving.  
		Measured in milliseconds (or sometimes seconds).  1000 milliseconds  
		= 1 second.  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Bandwith</h2></div>
		<p> <b>Bandwith</b> is the amount of information that can be 
		transmitted per unit of time.  Rate of Information = Info / Time.  Measured 
		in pits/sec.  More commonly on the internet it's measured in Megabits 
		per second (Mbps) (or million bits per second).  You can test your bandwith 
		with an internet speed test (cnet.com has one).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Bit</h2></div>
		<p>A <b>bit</b> is the smallest unit of information.  Two choices of bits 
		are "0" and "1".  1 bit lets you make one decision (on/off, yes/no).  4 bits 
		will allow you to encode 16 numbers.  Each bit you add doubles the number 
		you can encode.  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Protocol</h2></div>
		<p>A <b>protocol</b> is a set of rules that tell you how two things can 
		communicate.  <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is the protocol 
		that is used on the web for clients to talk to servers.  Clients can send one 
		message, "GET."  Servers then send a response back to the client.  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>URL</h2></div>
		<p>A <b>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</b> has a protocol, host, and 
		path.  In http://www.udacity.com/path/path2/path3/, for example, the http is the protocol, the 
		//www.udacity.com is the host (or domain), and the path is the document after 
		the last "/".  URLs have <b>Query Parameters</b>, or a GET Parameters.  Query 
		parameters are in the format of "Name = Value".  For example, in: <br>
		http://example.com/foo?P=1<br>
		The query parameter starts with a "?" followed by P, the name, then "=", then 
		1, the name.  All Query parameters following the first one are separated by a 
		"&" symbol like the following: <br>
		http://example.com/foo?P=1&Q=neat<br>
		P and 1 are the first Name and Value and Q and neat are the second Name and 
		value.  Basically, these are extra information. </p> 
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Cache</h2></div>
		<p>A <b>cache</b>, pronounced like cash, is something that stores data so that 
		you don't have to retrieve it later.  It can be used to make data requests faster.  
		<a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cache1.htm">More Cache info</a> 
		in this link.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Fragment</h2></div>
		<p>A <b>fragment</b> is separated from the rest of the URL with a "#".  A 
		fragment is generally used to reference a particular part of the page you are 
		looking at.  They can also be used in more complex JavaScript applications.  
		The most important thing to know now is that fragments are NOT sent to the 
		server.  They only exist in the browser.  Fragments always follow the query 
		parameters like the following: <br>
		http://example.com/foo?P=1#fragment<br></p>
	</div>
		<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Port</h2></div>
		<p>The <b>port</b> is located between the host and the path.  By default, 
		the port = 80.  However, you can change the port for different purposes.  The 
		port in the following example is 8000: <br>
		http://localhost:<b>8000</b>/</br>
		This URL will be our local development URL for a lot of this course and most of 
		your development life.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>HTTP</h2></div>
		<div class="hbox"><h4>HTTP Request Line and Headers</h4></div>
		<p><b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is the what your browser 
		uses to talk to web servers.  The <b>HTTP Request Line</b> has 3 parts:  
		GET    /foo    HTTP/1.1.  1st is the Method, GET.  2nd is the Path, /foo, the actual 
		document you are requesting.  3rd is the Version, HTTP/1.1.  Post is another 
		less common method. In <b>http://example.com/foo/logo.png?P=1#tricky</b> 
		the Request line is <b>GET  /foo/logo.png?P=1 HTTP/1.1 </b>.  Notice the 
		host and the fragment are not included.  In the previous example, the relative 
		path, /foo/logo.png?P=1, was given.  However, you could also specify the full 
		path, or Absolute Path, which is http://example.com/foo/logo.png?p=1. 
		
		<b>Headers</b> follow the request line.  Headers are in the following format: 
		Name: Value.  For example, the following are headers: <br>
		Host: www.example.com<br>
		User-Agent: chrome<br>
		The host is included in a header because servers host multiple websites, so this 
		tells the server what website you are requesting.  The user-agent tells the host 
		who is accessing the website.  You can block unwanted users by blocking their 
		user-agent.  You can make up all of the headers you want.  
		<div class="hbox"><h4>HTTP Responses</h4></div>
		<p>HTTP Responses looks similar to a request.  <b>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</b> 
		is an example of a response.  HTTP/1.1 is the <b>status line</b>.  The version matches 
		the version of the request line.  HTTP/1.1 is followed by 200, the <b>status code</b>, 
		and OK, the <b>reason phrase</b>.
		<ul> Status Codes:
			<li>200 OK - The document is found</li>
			<li>302 Found - The document is located somewhere else</li>
			<li>404 Not found - The document wasn't found</li>
			<li>500 Server Error - The server broke while handling your request</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>HTTP Response Headers
			<li>Date: Tue Mar 2012 04:33:33 GMT</li>
			<li>Server: Apache /2.2.3 (not required...use fake name to avoid hacks)</li>
			<li>Content-Type: text/html;</li>
			<li>Content-Length: 1539 (not required)</li>
		</ul>
		</p></p>
	</div>
	<div class="pbox">
		<div class="hbox"><h2>Servers</h2></div>
		<p>The purpose of a <b>server</b> is to respond to HTTP requests.  There 
		2 main classifications to the responses a server will use:  Static and Dynamic.  
		Static is a pre-written file or an image.  Dynamic request are made on the fly 
		by web applications.  Almost all webpages are using dynamic requests.
