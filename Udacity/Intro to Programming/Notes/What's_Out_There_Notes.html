		<ul>
			<li>Using JavaScript to bring web pages to life</li>
			<li>Using APIs to easily access powerful data</li>
			<li>Two fascinating ideas in computing:  recursion and parallel computing</li>

		<div class="hbox"><h2>JavaScript</h2></div>
		<p>JavaScript(JS) runs natively in in the browser.  Saving variables in 
		JS and Python are the same except "var" must come before 
		the variable name.  Ex: var firstName = "James".  All numbers in 
		JS are saved as 64bit floating point variables.  Arrays, Functions, 
		and Objects in JS all use the same syntax.  console.log is used to 
		"print" an object to the console.  alert(), confirm, and prompt() will 
		cause a pop-up window.  The console can be found in any 
		browser in the dev tools section.  JS is inserted between &ltscript&gt 
		&lt/script&gt tags.  Below this is a message that isn't visible in html, 
		but will show up in the console.
		<script>var awesomeThoughts = "Todd is awesome."  
		console.log(awesomeThoughts)
		</script><br>
		<div class="hbox"><h3>JavaScript Replace</h3></div>
		The replace function in JS can be very useful.  A simple example:<br> 
		var email = "toddmblankenship@gmail.com"<br>
		var newEmail = email.replace("nfsm", "gmail");<br>
		console.log(email)<br>
		console.log(newEmail)<br>
		Check the console for the previous example in action.
		<script>
		var email = "toddmblankenship@gmail.com";
		var newEmail = email.replace("gmail", "nfsm");
		console.log(email);
		console.log(newEmail);
		</script>
		<div class="hbox"><h3>Truthy / Falsy</h3></div>
		<ul>
			<li>true | false</li>
			<li>non-zero numbers | 0</li>
			<li>"strings" | "" (empty string)</li>
			<li>objects | undefined (variable doesn't exist)</li>
			<li>arrays | null (variable exist, but doesn't have a value)</li>
			<li>functions | NaN (Not a Number)</li>
			All evaluate to: true | false
		</ul>
		Arrays in JS behave the same way lists do in python.  Arrays are special 
		types of objects in JS.  JS Doesn't Have Classes.  Objects can be declared 
		and defined with var myObj = { };.  For example: (see console)<br>
		<script>
		var bio = {
			"name" : "Todd",
			"age" : 30,
			"education" : "M.S.",
			"skills" : "Programming, HTML, JS, Python, CSS"};
		console.log(bio)
		</script>
		<div class="hbox"><h3>JSON</h3></div>
		JSON, <b>JavaScript Object Notation</b>, is a popular and simple format 
		for storing and transferring nesting hierarchal data.  In JS, we use {} to 
		declare an object.  It's so popular that most other languages have libraries 
		capable of parsing and writing JSON (like Python JSON library).  Internet 
		GET and POST request frequently pass data in JSON format.  JSON allows 
		for objects (or data of other types) to be easily encapsulated within other 
		objects.  See MDN and JSON.org for more details.  <br>
		<a href="http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/"> This</a> 
		is a fantastic deep dive from Jason Lengstorf about JSON and its ubiquitous 
		use in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)"> 
		AJAX requests.</a><br>
		WHY LINT JSON? If you're generating JSON by hand, you should copy and 
		paste your JSON into a linter like jsonlint.com to quickly and easily find 
		syntax errors.  It's easy to make mistakes with JSON.  JavaScript 
		uses three primary notations:  [Bracket Notation], Dot.Notation, and 
		"object" : "literal" notation.  Do a google search to see more details on 
		the differences between them.

		<div class="hbox"><h2>Data Structures and APIs</h2></div>
		<p>
		APIs, or <b>Application Programming Interface</b>, allows your server 
		to communicate with other servers through HTTP without an HTML or 
		browser format.  How do servers communicate?  It's best if servers do 
		not communicate with HTML because HTML if very forgiving of errors.  
		<b>XML</b> is one way servers can communicate and it was created 
		in the late 1990s as a way of expressing data between computers 
		systems.  It is easy to parse.  It looks a lot like html because they share 
		a common ansestor, SGML, that was created in the 1980s.  You can 
		parse XML in Python using:  from xml.dom import minidom.  DOM 
		stands for Document Object Model.  <b>JSON</b>, JavaScript Object 
		Notation, is another way servers can communicate.  Anything you can 
		express in XML, you can express in JSON.  JSON uses dictionaries and 
		lists.  They can include int, strings, boolean, floats, and nulls.  You can 
		use JSON in Python with:  import json.  <b>How to be a good citizen 
		on the internet.</b>  Use a good user-agent.  Rate-limit yourself.  
		<ul>
		Other common protocols and methods for communicating across the 
		internet:
			<li>SOAP - invented by MS to make communcation as difficult as 
			possible.</li>
			<li>Protocol buffers - from Google(similar to JSON)</li>
			<li>Thrift - from Facebook</li>
			<li> JSON - most popular</li>
			<li>XML - ver popular as well</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="hbox"><h2>Recursion and Parallel Computing</h2></div>
		<p>
			<ol>
			<b>Recursive Definitions</b>
				<li>Base case - a starting point</li>
				Not defined in terms of itself.  Smallest input(already know the answer)
				x = 1
				<li>Recursive case - Defined in terms of a "smaller" version of itself</li>
				x = x + 1
			</ol>
		Defining procedures recursively:<br>
		factorial(0) = 1 (this is base case)<br>
		factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1) (this is recursive case)<br>
		<b>Palindromes</b> are strings that read front-to-back the same as 
		back-to-front.  Example:  "level", "a", " ".  To define a procedure to test 
		if a string is a palindrome, your base case would be and empty string, ' '.  
		<b>Map Reduce</b> processes data in parallel.  Parallel processing 
		allows multiple items of a list to be processed at the same time.  Map 
		Reduce uses multiple Mappers that process data at the same time .  
		This is called Intermediate Records.  All records are in Key, Value pairs.  
		Shuffle and Sort is then run on the Intermediate Records data before 
		sending the sorted data to the Reducers.  Reducers then process all of 
		the data of a certain key, so the value of key total will be the sum of 
		all instances of the value of that key within the dataset.
